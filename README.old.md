exploring music across tallahassee neighborhoods

**Ideas**: 
- a collaborative playlist, based on what people are listening to across different areas of Tallahassee

**Inspiration**:
- A Reddit post called "My parting gift to Tallahassee" [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/qth6ut/my_parting_gift_to_tallahassee/)

**Questions/Future Direction**:
- Can we use the Spotify API to pull historical music records to determine if the area has been "gentrified"?
